# cordova-sample-app

Just to exercise the latest and greatest Cordova 10 hybrid app development framework.
I want to create a new plugin for another project I'm working, wanted to try this with a clean installation.

**Roadmap**
1. Configure iOS/Android builds
2. Run on simulators for both platforms
3. Build a custom plugin
